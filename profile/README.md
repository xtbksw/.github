The KSW 100 gala, which will take place on Friday in Gliwice, is approaching with great strides. All fans of combat sports have been waiting for this day for a long time, because it will be an anniversary edition, where we can expect hit fights.

The fight between Mamed Khalidov and Adrian Bartosiński is the most exciting. Khalidov is a legend of Polish MMA and has fought 33 fights in KSW so far. However, on Friday evening he will have a very difficult task ahead of him. Bartosiński is the welterweight champion and will certainly want to show himself from the best side.

Perhaps one of the most important events in the history of Polish MMA is ahead of us. The direction in which the federation and the entire discipline will develop may depend on the success of the XTB KSW 100 anniversary gala. KSW itself has been building its reputation for years, tried various solutions, and on the way to the 100th gala, it managed to, among other things, visit the PGE National Stadium twice. The 100th gala will not be organized in such an iconic place, but it will also be a slightly less important one, because KSW 100 will take place in Gliwice, where the federation has visited 7 times so far. Such a big event could not miss the KSW champions, of whom we will see three, although there will be "only" two championship fights.

Rafał Haratyk will defend his belt against Marcin Wójcik, and Phil De Fries against Darko Stosic, whom he has already defeated once in defense of the title, at the beginning of 2022. The third champion, Adrian Bartosński, who holds the welterweight belt, will fight Mamed Khalidov from the middleweight category, so if he loses, he will not lose his belt. For the first time, a three-digit number will appear next to the KSW logo. XTB KSW 100 is the only such anniversary, the fruit of which will be seen on November 16 in Gliwice. In the evening's main event, the legend who has been associated with the organization almost from the very beginning, Mamed Khalidov, will cross gloves with the young adept and champion of the organization of the welterweight category, Adrian Bartosiński. The gentlemen will meet in the middleweight category limit.

In addition, we will see three more championship fights. Robert Ruchała and Kacper Formela will fight for the temporary featherweight belt. Later, the weight bar will move a little higher and Rafał Haratyk and Marcin Wójcik will compete for the 84 kg championship. We will also see a rematch at the top of the royal category. The absolute dominator Phil De Fries will once again defend his title against Darko Stosic. Their first fight took place in February 2022, where the Englishman proved to be better.

In addition to the great champions, fans will see, among others, their favorite Arkadiusz Wrzosek, who is still undefeated in the KSW cage. The fight of the 9th fighter in the KSW heavyweight ranking with the number three, Matheus Scheffel, will certainly be a big challenge, but a win could provide him with a significant jump in the table. In the middleweight category, Damian Janikowski will want to prove in the fight with Piotrek Kuberski that he deserves another chance to fight for the championship title.
